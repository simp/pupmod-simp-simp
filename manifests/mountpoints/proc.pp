# Mount ``/proc``
#
# @param proc_hidepid
#   * 0: This is the default setting and gives you the default
#        behavior
#
#   * 1: With this option an normal user would not see other processes but
#        their own about ``ps``, ``top`` , etc..., but they are still able to
#        see process IDs in ``/proc``
#
#   * 2 (default): Users are only able to see their own processes (like with
#       ``hidepid=1``), and process IDs are also hidden in ``/proc``!
#
#   * **NOTE:** This option has no effect if ``$manage_proc`` is not ``true``
#
# @param proc_gid
#   This group will be able to see all processes on the system regardless of
#   the ``$proc_hidepid`` setting
