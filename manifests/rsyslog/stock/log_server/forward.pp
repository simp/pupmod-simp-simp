# == Class: simp::rsyslog::stock::log_server::forward
#
# Set this appropriately if you're forwarding your syslog data to somewhere
# else.
#
# Define for adding fowarding hosts to the log server.
#
# DO NOT make forward_hosts the local log host, this will cause all kinds of
# problems with looping logs and eat your disks.
#
# Note: This will forward *all* logs to the named hosts.
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*forward_hosts*]
#   Type: Array
#     The hosts to which to forward the logs.
#     Be sure to append the port to the host if you wish to send to an
#     alternate port.
#
# [*failover_forward_hosts*]
#   Type: Array
#   Default: []
#     If present, the listed systems will be used as failover servers for the
#     forwarded records.
#
# [*log_transport*]
#   Type: One of ['tcp','udp','relp']
#   The transport to pass the data across. Make sure it stays lower case.
