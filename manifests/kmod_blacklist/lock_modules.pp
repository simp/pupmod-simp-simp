# This class toggles the ability to load any further kernel modules into the
# system until the system has been rebooted.
#
# This will only take effect if the system has the ``kernel.modules_disabled``
# sysctl feature.
#
# @param enable
#   Lock all module loading abilities
#
# @param notify_if_reboot_required
#   If the change requires the system to be rebooted to take effect, a
#   notification will be printed during puppet runs until the system has been
#   rebooted.
#
# @param persist
#   Lock all modules at boot time.
#
#  * WARNING: It is *highly* likely that you will prevent important modules
#    from loading (such as networking) if you enable this. Test thoroughly
#    before enabling.
