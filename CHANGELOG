- Fix a usability bug in which simp::server::kickstart did not allow
  the bootstrap scripts provided by simp::server::kickstart::runpuppet
  and simp::server::kickstart::simp_client_bootstrap to be configured
  via hieradata, when those classes were managed by simp::server::kickstart.

* Mon Aug 27 2018 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.6.0-0
- Switch from using 'sudosh' as the default logging shell to using 'tlog'
- Add a 'simp::admin::default_admin_sudo_cmnds' option to allow users to easily

  match the new Puppet 5 method of setting resource defaults.

* Tue Jul 17 2018 Nick Miller <nick.miller@onyxpoint.com> - 4.6.0-0
- Added tests and support for OEL and Puppet 5
  - Setting the default filebucket in a module no longer works, so

* Thu May 03 2018 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 4.5.0-0
- Created standalone SIMP client bootstrap script, bootstrap_simp_client.
- Created simp::server::kickstart::runpuppet replacement,
  simp::server::kickstart::simp_client_bootstrap, that manages service
  files for kickstarting a SIMP client, using bootstrap_simp_client
  and either a sysv (simp_client_bootstrap) or a systemd
  (simp_client_bootstrap.service) service script. This replacement
  provides the following improvements:
  - Exponential backoff of requests to the Puppet server, to minimize
    Puppet server overload.
  - Configurable bootstrap timeout.
  - An option to force a client reboot on client bootstrap failure.
  - More effective puppet agent processing.  The bootstrapping
    takes fewer puppet agent runs.
  - Finer grained control of the bootstrap algorithm.
  - Error handling
    - Bootstrap operation errors are now detected and logged.
    - Failed puppet agent runs are now retried, instead of blindly
      continuing on.
  - Timestamped log messages in the bootstrap log file.  This includes
    messages from bootstrap_simp_client, puppet agent, and fixfiles.
    service start
- simp::server::kickstart::runpuppet is deprecated and will be removed
  in a future release

* Mon Apr 23 2018 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> 4.5.0-0
- simp_options::selinux was supposed to determine if the selinux module was
  included.  However, this value was getting overridden by the class lists
  which independently included the selinux module. This change removes the
  unused simp_options::selinux setting to eliminate the confusion.  See the
  scenario maps in the data section to see what scenarios include the selinux
  module.  See the selinux module to see how to use puppet to enable/disable
  selinux.  This may change the defaults for selinux in the `simp_lite`
  scenario.

* Tue Apr 17 2018 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.5.0-0

  for EL7, persist the hostname retrieved by DHCP as a static hostname.
  This prevents problems that can arise on EL7 when the DHCP lease
  expires in the middle of the client bootstrap puppet runs.

* Mon Apr 02 2018 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> - 4.5.0-0

  `%administrators` group could `rm -rf` any path
- The value in the hash was also corrected to
  `$facts['puppet_settings']['main']['ssldir']`

* Fri Mar 09 2018 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 4.4.0-0
- Set the ownership and permissions of puppet/puppetdb.conf in
  simp::puppetdb, instead of allowing them to be set to those of
  the process running puppet, if the file needs to be created.
  This is part of the fix to the failure of SIMP to bootstrap on a
  system on which root's umask has already been restricted to 077.

  `simp_openldap::client` class.

* Tue Jan 16 2018 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 4.4.0-0
- Add simp::prelink to the class lists for both the SIMP server and
  SIMP clients. By default, simp::prelink ensures any prelinking has
  been removed and that the prelink package is not installed. This
  satisfies the SCAP Security Guide's OVAL check
  xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_disable_prelink.

* Mon Nov 18 2017 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 4.3.0-0
- In simp::sysctl, add parameters for net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route
  and net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route and set them to 0 by
  default.  This satisfies STIG CCI-0000366.

  in our code.
